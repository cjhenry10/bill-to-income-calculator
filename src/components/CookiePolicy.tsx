      <h3>Introduction</h3>

        We value your privacy and aim to be transparent about how your data is

      <h3>What is Local Storage?</h3>
      <p>
        Local storage is a feature of your web browser that allows us to store
        small amounts of data in your browser. Local storage data is different
        than cookies. Unlike cookies, data stored in local storage isn't sent to
        the server with each request.
      </p>
      <h3>What Data Do We Store?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          We use local storage to save the information you enter into forms on

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Text and number input fields</li>
          <li>Selections from dropdown menus</li>

      <h3>Why Do We Use Local Storage?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          The primary purpose of using local storage is to improve your
          experience on our site by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Allowing you to save your work and return to it later without losing
            any information
          </li>
          <li>Providing a seamless and uninterrupted user experience</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>How Does This Benefit You?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>By using local storage, we ensure that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your form inputs are preserved even if you navigate away from the
            page or close your browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can continue your work from where you left off without having to
            re-enter information.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
