# Income Calculators
https://income-calculators.showcase.run/

This application currently has two tools that can:

- determine your annual income needs based on monthly expenses
- share equal savings with everyone who shares your monthly expenses

The project is built with React.js and TypeScript. For components and styling I used TailwindCSS and shadcnui. There is no backend, but work is saved in local storage.
